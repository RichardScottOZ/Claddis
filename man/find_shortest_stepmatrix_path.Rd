\title{Finds the shortest path between two states in a stepmatrix}
\usage{
find_shortest_stepmatrix_path(stepmatrix, start, end)
}
\arguments{
\item{stepmatrix}{An object of class \code{stepMatrix}.}

\item{start}{The start state for the requested path.}

\item{end}{The end state of the requested path.}
}
\value{
A vector of states describing one optimal path in the order \code{start} to \code{end}.
}
\description{
Given a start and end state, returns the shortest path through a stepmatrix.
}
\details{
A common problem in graph theory is identifying the shortest path to take between two vertices of a connected graph. A stepmatrix also describes a graph, with transition costs representing edge weights that can be asymmetric (e.g., going from 0 to 1 can have a different weight than going from 1 to 0). Finding the shortest path between states - i.e., the path that minimises total weight (cost) - from a stepmatrix has two main applications in Claddis: 1. to check a stepmatrix is internally consistent (no cost is misidentified due to a "cheaper" route being available - solving a problem identified in Maddison and Maddison 2003), and 2. to identify the minimum number of steps a character could have on a tree (an essential aspect of various homoplasy metrics, see Hoyal Cuthill et al. 2010).

This function implements a slightly modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm (Dijkstra 1959) to deal with the special case of a cladistic-style stepmatrix. The core code is taken from \link[https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/10/finding-the-shortest-path-with-dijkstras-algorithm/]{this} R-bloggers post.

Note: if multiple equally optimal solutions are possible, the function will only return one of them. I.e., just because a solution is not presented it cannot be assumed it is suboptimal. For example, for any ordered character (of three or more states) there will always be multiple equally optimal solutions.

\examples{

# Make a four-state Dollo stepmatrix:
stepmatrix <- Claddis::make_stepmatrix(
  min_state = 0,
  max_state = 3,
  character_type = "dollo",
  include_polymorphisms = FALSE,
  polymorphism_shape = "hypersphere",
  polymorphism_distance = "great_circle",
  dollo_penalty = 100
)

# Find the shortest path from state 0 to state 3:
find_shortest_stepmatrix_path(
  stepmatrix = stepmatrix,
  start = "0",
  end = "3"
)

# Show that this is directional by asking for the reverse path:
find_shortest_stepmatrix_path(
  stepmatrix = stepmatrix,
  start = "3",
  end = "0"
)
