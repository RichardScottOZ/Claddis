CHANGES IN CLADDIS VERSION 0.2

  NEW FEATURES
    o Added citation file to package.
    o Added internal and terminal branch versions of the time series output for DiscreteCharacterRate. This was added for sensitivity tests in Close et al. (2015).
    o Added this NEWS file to keep users abreast of changes to Claddis.

  BUG FIXES
    o Fixed bug in output from SafeTaxonomicReduction that stops matrices being converted to vectors (thanks to Dave Bapst).
    o Removed random seed file that could corrupt stochastic functions (thanks to Dave Bapst). This should not have caused problems as no core functions are stochastic at present.
    o Removed duplicated line in AncEstMatrix (thanks to Thomas Guillerme). This should speed up this function and the main rate function which calls it, but should not have lead to any actual errors.

  OTHER CHANGES
    o Added reference to Close et al. (2015): technically the first published paper to use Claddis itself. (Older papers made use of earlier versions of the core functions.)
    o Added warning to help file for CorrectRootTime to tell user that this can only be used for trees of minimally three taxa (thanks to Dave Bapst). This is really an edge case issue, but for some other functions trees with two taxa are allowed.
    o Converted entire package to Roxygen. This should not affect the user experience at all.
    o Fixed typo in Yang et al. (1995) citation.
    o Removed an .Rhistory file that was accidentally being included in the tarball.
