# MAKE A TREE-LENGTH FUNCTION (THAT HAPPENS TO EXPORT NODE VALUES)
# THEN MAKE SEPARATE ANCESTRAL STATE RECONSTRUCTION FUNCTION THAT CALLS THIS OTHER FUNCTION



#' Can be used to infer ancestral states or get tree lengths (could theoretically buol a tree inference procedure around this by proposing different topologies, but ikely to be much slower than compiled software). Also a first step to generating character maps that can be used for plotting changes on a tree, performing rate analysis (see \link{test_rates}), or generating phylomorphospaces (not implemented yet).
#'
#' \bold{Input}
#'
#' To use this function data must first be in the correct format.
#'
#' - Tree
#' - Cladistic matrix (currently tip_states)
#'
#' \bold{Options}
#'
#' Come in two forms, those implicit (as decided by values in cladisticmatrix) and explicit to this function.
#'
#' \emph{Implicit options}
#'
#' - Stepmatrix
#' - Weight (only affects tree length) - defaults to one as this is typical value used. This can disappear once cladistic matrix is input.
#'
#' \emph{Explicit options}
#'
#' - inapplicables_as_missing = FALSE, what to do with inapplicable characters. Currently treat as missing is only real option, but can be differet state that is also inferred as an ancestor.
#' - More for uncertianties and polymorphisms (see below).
#' - Add option to predict missing tip values (but definitely not recommended! - see Lloyd 2018)
#' - Collpasing to a single output with ACCTRAN etc.?
#'
#' \bold{Implementation}
#'
#' Algorithms for reconstructing ancestral states under parsimony can be specific (e.g., for ordered characters only) or general (allowing for any character type, including highly specific custom-formats). The advantage of the former is usually that they are faster as multiple assumptions are already built in, but the latter offer more flexibility and represent the version applied here.
#'
#' More specifically this function is based on the approach described by Swofford and Maddison (1992) that assumes a rooted tree and uses a stepmatrix to define the costs (in number of steps) of specific transitions, i.e., from state X to state Y. The rooting is key here as it sets the directionality of evolution (i.e., time) and hence allows the use of asymmetric characters (where the cost of going from state X to state Y is different than going from stete Y to state X) as well as other direction-based optimisations (e.g., ACCTRAN and DELTRAN).
#'
#'
#' \bold{Special character types}
#' \emph{Missing values}
#' \emph{Inapplicables}
#' \emph{Uncertainties}
#'
#' In Claddis, uncertainties are coded by separating states with the slash character, e.g., 0/1. The Swofford and Maddison (1992) algorithm - and the implementation used here - treats uncertainties (automatically) by allowing any of the possible states at the tip (here 0 or 1, but not, say, 2 or 3). In other words, it will opt for solutions that effectively prefer whichever state is easiest (fewest steps) to reach from a proposed ancestral value. This could therefore be used to predict what the "true" value may be, at least under the assumption of parsimony. However, such phylogenetic "prediction" [OPTION?] is generally advised against (Lloyd 2018).
#'
#' \emph{Polymorphisms}
#'
#' TEXT?
#'
#' \bold{Polytomies}
#'
#' Another advantage of the Swofford and Maddison (1992) approach is that it does not require fully-bifurcating topologies, hence these are "allowed" as input. However, it is important to note that the implementation here will treat any such polytomies (also known as multifurcations) as "hard". I.e., that they genuinely represent one species splitting into three or more descendant species. As always, the Ian Malcolm caveat applies - "your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they sould, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should."


#'
#'
#' # Option to fix root state (polarize) somehow
#' # From is row, to is column (directional hence requires/assumes rooted trees)
#' # Record in manual that weighted parsimony is folly, but could use to chose between MPRs (maybe?)

#' \bold{Polymorphic characters}
#'

#' # MANUAL: generalized (stepmatrix) solution as accounts for more possibilities
#' # MANUAL: really only for rooted trees (unrooted possible using same methods (see Swofford and Maddison (1992), but unclear why you would want to do this with trees without direction of time (i.e., a root).
#' # MANUAL: works with multifurcations and doesn't require a fully bifurcating tree, but does assume polytomies are therefore "hard".
#' # MANUAL: Swofford and Maddison (1992; p210): "Both [ACCTRAN and DELTRAN] start by either assuming that the ancestral state is known or by choosing a state from the set of optimal assignments to the root node" - i.e., always an arbitrainess problem at root!
#' MISSING DATA (NA) IS DEALT WITH BY SETTING ALL TIP VALUES FOR A MISSING STATE TO ZERO (AS PER SWOFFORD AND MADDISON 1992).
#' UNCERTAIN STATES (E.G., 0/1) CONSTRAIN ANCESTRAL STATES SLIGHTLY MORE THAN NA (ASSUMING THEY EXCLUDE SOME STATES. IMPLEMENTATION SAME AS SWOFFORD AND MADDISON (1992).
#' CALCULATES TREE LENGTHS!
#'
#' ASYMMETRIC TRANSITIONS REQUIRE YOU TO KNOW POLARITY A PRIORI!
#' HOW TO TREAT POLYTOMIES? MANY ISSUES RAISED IN SWOFFORD AND MADDISON (1992). ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IN LIKELIHOOD SUGGESTED BY REVELL.
#'
#' Users may also wish to refer to the more complex whole-matrix, likelihood-based function \link{estimate_ancestral_states}. Although, note that eventually parsimony will simply be an option to that function.

  # ALLOW FOR MULTIPLE TREES?
  
  # TO DO
  # - Conditional for invariant character plus autapomorphic ones (fast solution that escapes estimates of other values)
  # - Allow for true polymorphisms (maybe conditionals for counting changes?) This is a hard problem!
  # - How to allow for missing or uncertainty? This bit should be easy as set all states to zero, or all uncertain states to zero at tips.
  # - All (format?)/ACCTRAN/DELTRAN/(Random?)/Branch lengths as weights to help collapse?/Uncertainity (e.g., 0/1)
  # - Missing and inapplicables shpuld probably be assigned to nodes on a third pass "down" the tree (tips to roots) such that any all-descendants set gets assigned an NA/"" too. Otherwise sets false certainity by "bleeding" an ancestral value "up" the tree.
  # - Tip states as entered need preserving separately as some modification will need to happen to the variable if certain options are chosen.
  # - Make options match estimate_ancestral_states:
  #   - @param estimate_all_nodes Logical that allows the user to make estimates for all ancestral values. The default (\code{FALSE}) will only make estimates for nodes that link coded terminals (recommended).
  #   - @param estimate_tip_values Logical that allows the user to make estimates for tip values. The default (\code{FALSE}) will only makes estimates for internal nodes (recommended).
  #   - @param polymorphism_behaviour One of either "equalp" or "treatasmissing".
  #   - @param uncertainty_behaviour One of either "equalp" or "treatasmissing".
  
  # CHECKS TO WRITE
  # - states are discrete
  # - states in tip states are all available in stepmatrix and vice versa
  # - stepmatrix values are zero or positive (don't have to be integers?)
  # - Check there are enough states to do something with!
  # - Put checks at higher level to avoid repeating for every character in a matrix (slow?)
