#' @details
#'
#' Under the maximum parsimony criterion, a phylogenetic hypothesis is considered optimal if it requires the fewest number of evolutionary "steps". In order to evalulate this criterion we must therefore be able to calculate a tree's "length" (total steps assuming the fewest possible steps for every character used). Given a set of phylogenetic hypothes(es) and a cladistic matrix this function calculates the minimum length for each tree.
#'
#' \bold{Input data format}
#'
#' This function operates on a phylogenetic tree, or trees (in \code{ape} format), and a cladistic matrix (in \link{cladisticMatrix} format [UPDATE]). However, the algorithm used is based on the generalised stepmatrix approach of Swofford and Maddison (1992) and hence stepmatrices need to be defined for each character (this is done internally by calling \link{make_stepmatrix}), and some of the options are merely passed to this function.
#'
#' \bold{Algorithm}
#'
#' Technically the Swofford and Maddison (1992) algorithm is designed for ancestral state reconstruction, but as its' first pass of the tree assigns lengths for each possible state at each node the minimum value of these options at the root is also the tree length for that character and hence by skipping the later steps this can be used as a tree length algorithm by simply adding these values for each character. The choice of the Swofford and Maddison algorithm, rather than the Wagner or Fitch algorithms (for ordered and unordered characters, respectively) is to generalize to the broadest range of character types, including asymmetric characters (Camin-Sokal, Dollo, stratigraphic), custom character types (specified using stepmatrices or character state trees), as well as to any resolution of tree (i.e., including multifurcating trees - important for establishing maximum step counts for homoplasy indices). The only restriction here is that the tree must be rooted such that time's arrow is explicitly present. This is essential, as the root defines the lengths across the whole tree, but also for asymmetric characters directionality must be explicit. The two obvious downsides to this algorithm is that it can be slower and that it is not appropriate for unrooted trees.
#'
#' \bold{Stepmatrices and stepmatrix options}
#'
#' Stepmatrices are described in detail in the \link{make_stepmatrix} manual, as are the options that are passed from this function to that one.




# Polymorphism options ("missing", "uncertainty", "polymorphism", or "random")
# - Treat as uncertainty (undercounts changes, may affect ASR)
# - Treat as missing (undercounts changes, may affect ASR)
# - Treat as states (requires stepmatrix to cover possibilities)




#' Can be used to infer ancestral states or get tree lengths (could theoretically build a tree inference procedure around this by proposing different topologies, but likely to be much slower than compiled software). Also a first step to generating character maps that can be used for plotting changes on a tree, performing rate analysis (see \link{test_rates}), or generating phylomorphospaces (not implemented yet).
#'
#' \emph{Explicit options}
#'
#' - inapplicables_as_missing = FALSE, what to do with inapplicable characters. Currently treat as missing is only real option, but can be differet state that is also inferred as an ancestor.
#' - More for uncertianties and polymorphisms (see below).
#' - Add option to predict missing tip values (but definitely not recommended! - see Lloyd 2018)
#' - Collpasing to a single output with ACCTRAN etc.?
#'
#' \bold{Implementation}
#'
#' Algorithms for reconstructing ancestral states under parsimony can be specific (e.g., for ordered characters only) or general (allowing for any character type, including highly specific custom-formats). The advantage of the former is usually that they are faster as multiple assumptions are already built in, but the latter offer more flexibility and represent the version applied here.
#'
#' More specifically this function is based on the approach described by Swofford and Maddison (1992) that assumes a rooted tree and uses a stepmatrix to define the costs (in number of steps) of specific transitions, i.e., from state X to state Y. The rooting is key here as it sets the directionality of evolution (i.e., time) and hence allows the use of asymmetric characters (where the cost of going from state X to state Y is different than going from stete Y to state X) as well as other direction-based optimisations (e.g., ACCTRAN and DELTRAN).
#'
#'
#' \bold{Special character types}
#' \emph{Missing values}
#' \emph{Inapplicables}
#' \emph{Uncertainties}
#'
#' In Claddis, uncertainties are coded by separating states with the slash character, e.g., 0/1. The Swofford and Maddison (1992) algorithm - and the implementation used here - treats uncertainties (automatically) by allowing any of the possible states at the tip (here 0 or 1, but not, say, 2 or 3). In other words, it will opt for solutions that effectively prefer whichever state is easiest (fewest steps) to reach from a proposed ancestral value. This could therefore be used to predict what the "true" value may be, at least under the assumption of parsimony. However, such phylogenetic "prediction" [OPTION?] is generally advised against (Lloyd 2018).
#'
#' \emph{Polymorphisms}
#'
#' TEXT?
#'
#' \bold{Polytomies}
#'
#' Another advantage of the Swofford and Maddison (1992) approach is that it does not require fully-bifurcating topologies, hence these are "allowed" as input. However, it is important to note that the implementation here will treat any such polytomies (also known as multifurcations) as "hard". I.e., that they genuinely represent one species splitting into three or more descendant species. As always, the Ian Malcolm caveat applies - "your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they sould, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should."


#'
#'
#' # Option to fix root state (polarize) somehow
#' # From is row, to is column (directional hence requires/assumes rooted trees)
#' # Record in manual that weighted parsimony is folly, but could use to chose between MPRs (maybe?)

#' \bold{Polymorphic characters}
#'
#' Random is same as PERDA approach of Watanabe [ADD REF]



#' # MANUAL: generalized (stepmatrix) solution as accounts for more possibilities
#' # MANUAL: really only for rooted trees (unrooted possible using same methods (see Swofford and Maddison (1992), but unclear why you would want to do this with trees without direction of time (i.e., a root).
#' # MANUAL: works with multifurcations and doesn't require a fully bifurcating tree, but does assume polytomies are therefore "hard".
#' # MANUAL: Swofford and Maddison (1992; p210): "Both [ACCTRAN and DELTRAN] start by either assuming that the ancestral state is known or by choosing a state from the set of optimal assignments to the root node" - i.e., always an arbitrainess problem at root!
#' MISSING DATA (NA) IS DEALT WITH BY SETTING ALL TIP VALUES FOR A MISSING STATE TO ZERO (AS PER SWOFFORD AND MADDISON 1992).
#' UNCERTAIN STATES (E.G., 0/1) CONSTRAIN ANCESTRAL STATES SLIGHTLY MORE THAN NA (ASSUMING THEY EXCLUDE SOME STATES. IMPLEMENTATION SAME AS SWOFFORD AND MADDISON (1992).

# - Algorithm (parsimony, ML, etc.) - for later integration into single ASR function with other options (likelihood, rerooting etc.)
# - CI? (Characters as vector then can do summed for matrix)
# - RI? (Need to know max value which is just fit on star tree)
# - N reversals (Will depend on root and "direction")
# - N parallelisms (Will depend on root and "direction")
# - Character map? (need to think carefully what this format should be and hence how stuff like ASE needs to inform it.)
# - MAKE THIS A CLASS TOO!



# WRITE SOME KIND OF CHECK FOR SELF-CONSISTENCY IN STEP MATRICES. I.E., THE DIRECT PATH IS ALWAYS THE SAME LENGTH OR SHORTER THAN AN INDIRECT ONE. E.G., If 0 -> 2 is 4 steps, but 0->1->2 is only 3 steps. (Citation is MacClade 4 manual!)
# OPTION TO CONSTRAIN PARTICULAR NODES AND/OR MAKE TAXA ANCESTORS (MIGHT BE TRICKY AND A DOWN THE LINE ADDITION!) HMMM. OR HAVE CONDITIONAL THAT SETS INFINITE VALUES TO THE NON PRESENT STATES AT THIS NODE?
# MORE OUTPUT OR SUMMARY OPTIONS COULD BE N CHANGES ON EACH BRANCH ACROSS MPRS, MEAN OF SAME, MIN AND MAX OF SAME. SIMILAR FOR CHANGE TYPES I.E., STEP MATRIX BUT ACTUALLY FREQUENCY OF CHANGES FOR EACH TRANSITION (THIS IS REALLY AN SCM OUTPUT).
# AS RATE TENDS TOWARD INFINITY THEN RECONSTRUCTION AT A NODE TENDS TOWARDS EQUAL FREQUENCY OF EACH STATE (I.E., MAXIMAL UNCERTAINTY).
# ALLOW TREES N STEPS LONGER SOMEHOW? OR RATHER MPRs ONE STEP LONGER, OR SOME OTHER VALUE OF USERS CHOOSING.
# "This illustrates the fact that ACCTRAN and DELTRAN do not always choose a single one of the most parsimonious reconstructions." MacClade 4 manual, page 99).
# "Note that MacClade, unlike PAUP*, does not choose the lowest-valued state at the root to begin these processes. Thus MacClade's ACCTRAN and DELTRAN may not fully resolve ambiguity in the ancestral state reconstruction."
# INTERMEDIATES ARE GONNA MATTER IF MOVING TO CHARACTER MAPS. E.G., IF ONLY 0 AND 2 ARE SAMPLED BUT A CHARACTER IS ORDERED THEN THERE ARE TWO CHANGES ALONG THE BRANCH NOT ONE TWO-STEP CHANGE.
# POLYMORPHISM APPROACH SHOULDN'T CONFOUND THE "NORMAL" BEHAVIOUR OF AN ORDERED OR UNORDERED CHARACTER.
# TEST WEIGHTING OF STRATOCLADISTICS BY USING A STRATIGRAPHIC CHARACTER AND WEIGHTING IT MULTIPLE WAYS (AS A SLIDER) AND SHOW HOW IT EFFECTS PARSIMONY VS STRAT CONGRUENCE TREE LANDSCAPES
# MONOFURCATIONS IDEA IN CASTOR IS INTERESTING AS ALLOWS POINT ESTIMATES ALONG BRANCHES (E.G., FOR SCM OF A CONTINUOUS CHARACTER)







### MPR function below here

#' Determine maximum parsimony ancestral state reconstruction(s)
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Given a tree, or set of trees, and a cladistic matrix returns all most parsimonious reconstruction(s) for every character.
#'
#' @param trees A tree (phylo object) or set of trees (multiPhylo object).
#' @param cladistic_matrix A character-taxon matrix in the format imported by \link{read_nexus_matrix}. These should be discrete with labels matching the tip labels of \code{tree}.
#' @param estimate_all_nodes Logical that allows the user to make estimates for all ancestral values. The default (\code{FALSE}) will only make estimates for nodes that link coded terminals (recommended).
#' @param estimate_tip_values Logical that allows the user to make estimates for tip values. The default (\code{FALSE}) will only makes estimates for internal nodes (recommended).
#' @param inapplicables_as_missing Logical that decides whether or not to treat inapplicables as missing (TRUE) or not (FALSE, the default and recommended option).
#' @param polymorphism_behaviour One of either "missing", "uncertainty", "polymorphism", or "random". See details.
#' @param uncertainty_behaviour One of either "missing", "uncertainty", "polymorphism", or "random". See details.
#' @param polymorphism_shape Argument passed to \link{make_stepmatrix}.
#' @param polymorphism_distance Argument passed to \link{make_stepmatrix}.
#' @param state_ages Argument passed to \link{make_stepmatrix}.
#' @param dollo_penalty Argument passed to \link{make_stepmatrix}.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Users may also wish to refer to the more complex whole-matrix, likelihood-based function \link{estimate_ancestral_states}. Although, note that eventually parsimony will simply be an option to that function.

# HOMOPLASY FUNCTION
# - Option to define outgroup (root state?) as will affect min steps value
# - Otherwise need to do path both ways, e.g., 0->1->2 and 2->1->0 in case of asymmetric characters
# - Keep check for variance as no changes at all if invariant.
# - How to handle uncertainties?
