#' Finds the minimum spanning tree length for a costmatrix
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Given a costmatrix, returns the length of the shortest tree that connects every state.
#'
#' @param costmatrix An object of class \code{costMatrix}.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The minimum parsimony length a phylogenetic hypothesis can have depends on the costmatrix of transition costs and the states actually sampled. If the costmatrix rows and columns already represent sampled states (the assumption here) then this minimum length is reduced to a graph theory problem - the minimum spanning tree. This function returns the length of that tree and hence the minimum cost (as used in stratocladistics to help define "parsimony debt" Fisher 1994, or in homoplasy indices, see Hoyal Cuthill 2015).
#'
#' \bold{Special case solutions}
#'
#' In order for the function to run as fast as possible the following special case solutions are used.
#'
#' \emph{Invariant character solution}
#'
#' If the character is invariant then the costmatrix will have size one (one-by-one), and more simply the minimum spanning tree is length zero as there are no transitions to make.
#'
#' \emph{Unordered character solution}
#'
#' If the character is unordered all off-diagonal values of the costmatrix are one and the minimum cost is the size of the costmatrix minus one (as there is no cost to visit the root state).
#'
#' \emph{Ordered/irreversible/stratigraphic character solution}
#'
#' For an ordered, irreversible, or stratigraphic character the solution is also simple, and identical. This is the cost to go between the furthest two states which is simply the value in the upper right of the costmatrix.
#'
#' \emph{Dollo character solution}
#'
#' Despite other complexities Dollo characters also have a simple solution that mirrors that for ordered, irreversible, or stratigraphic characters. I.e., the derived states must all be acquired once which is simply the value in the lower left of the costmatrix.
#'
#' \bold{General case solution}
#'
#' For characters that do not constitute any of the above special case solutions a slower running general case solution is required. This is effectively limited to so-called "custom" characters - \code{costmatrix$type = "custom"} that can \emph{only} be represented by either a state tree or costmatrix.
#'
#' Strictly speaking the solution used depends on whether the costmatrix is symmetric (representing an undirected graph, or simply a graph) or asymmetric (representing a directed graph, or digraph). In both cases the edge weights of the graph/digraph are the transition costs from the costmatrix. For a graph the problem is the "regular" minimum spanning tree, and if for a digraph then it is the arboresence. For regular minimum spanning trees Kruskal's (1956) algorithm is used and for aboresence's Edmonds' (1967) algorithm is used. (The function automatically makes this choice using the value of \code{costmatrix$symmetry}.) In practice the implementations used come from the optrees package (Fontenla 2014), and specifically the functions \code{getMinimumSpanningTree} and \code{msArborEdmonds}.
#'
#' Note that regardless of method the function only returns the \emph{length} of the minimum spanning tree or arboresence (i.e., the total minimum cost), not the actual path (pattern of states traversed). Additionally, multiple paths (trees or arboresences) may exist that have the same minimum length - i.e., there can be more than one optimal solution.
