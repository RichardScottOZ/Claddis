#' Finds the shortest path between two states in a stepmatrix
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Given a start and end state, returns the shortest path through a stepmatrix.
#'
#' @param stepmatrix An object of class \code{stepMatrix}.
#' @param start The start state for the requested path.
#' @param end The end state of the requested path.

#' A common problem in graph theory is identifying the shortest path to take between two vertices of a connected graph. A stepmatrix also describes a graph, with transition costs representing edge weights that can be asymmetric (e.g., going from 0 to 1 can have a different weight than going from 1 to 0). Finding the shortest path between states - i.e., the path that minimises total weight (cost) - from a stepmatrix has two main applications in Claddis: 1. to check a stepmatrix is internally consistent (no cost is misidentified due to a "cheaper" route being available - solving a problem identified in Maddison and Maddison 2003), and 2. to identify the minimum number of steps a character could have on a tree (an essential aspect of various homoplasy metrics, see Hoyal Cuthill et al. 2010).
#'
#' This function implements a slightly modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm (Dijkstra 1959) to deal with the special case of a cladistic-style stepmatrix. The core code is taken from \link[https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/10/finding-the-shortest-path-with-dijkstras-algorithm/]{this} R-bloggers post.
#'
#' Note: if multiple equally optimal solutions are possible, the function will only return one of them. I.e., just because a solution is not presented it cannot be assumed it is suboptimal. For example, for any ordered character (of three or more states) there will always be multiple equally optimal solutions.
