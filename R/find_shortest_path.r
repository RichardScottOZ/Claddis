#' Finds the shortest path between two states in a stepmatrix
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Given a start and end state, returns the shortest path through a stepmatrix.
#'
#' @param stepmatrix An object of class \code{stepMatrix}.
#' @param start The start state for the requested path.
#' @param end The end state of the requested path.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' A common problem in graph theory is identifying the shortest path to take between two vertices of a connected graph. A stepmatrix also describes a graph, with transition costs representing edge weights that can be asymmetric (e.g., going from 0 to 1 can have a different weight than going from 1 to 0). Finding the shortest path between states - i.e., the path that minimises total weiight (cost) - from a stepmatrix has two main applications in Claddis: 1. to check a stepmatrix is internally consistent (no cost is misidentified due to a "cheaper" route being available - solving a problem identified in MADDISON), and 2. to identify the minimum number of steps a character could have on a tree (an essential aspect of various homoplasy metrics, Hoyal Cuthill et al. 2010).
#'
#' This function implements a slightly modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm (Dijkstra 1959) to deal with the special case of a cladistic-style stepmatrix. The core code is taken from \link[https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/10/finding-the-shortest-path-with-dijkstras-algorithm/]{this} R-bloggers post.

  # Sub function to give path length:

    # If path is NULL return infinite length:
    if (is.null(path)) return(Inf)
    
    # Get all consecutive nodes:
    pairs <- cbind(values = path[-length(path)], ind = path[-1])
    
    # Join with G and sum over weights
    sum(merge(x = pairs, y = G)[ , "weights"])
  }
  
  # Recursive subfunction to find shortest path:
  find_the_shortest_path <- function(graph, start, end, path = c()) {
    
    # if there are no nodes linked from current node (= dead end) return NULL
    if (is.null(graph[[start]])) return(NULL)
    
    # add next node to path so far

    if (start == end) return(path)
    
    # initialize shortest path as NULL
    shortest <- NULL
    
    # loop through all nodes linked from the current node (given in start)
    for (node in graph[[start]]) {
      
      # proceed only if linked node is not already in path
      if (!(node %in% path)) {
        
        # recursively call function for finding shortest path with node as start and assign it to newpath
        newpath <- find_the_shortest_path(graph, node, end, path)
        
        # if newpath is shorter than shortest so far assign newpath to shortest
        if (path_length(newpath) < path_length(shortest))
        shortest <- newpath
      }
    }
    
    # return shortest path
    shortest
  }
  
  # Return shortest path:
  find_the_shortest_path(graph = graph, start = start, end = end)
}

# HOMOPLASY FUNCTION
# - Option to define outgroup (root state?) as will affect min steps value
# - Otherwise need to do path both ways, e.g., 0->1->2 and 2->1->0 in case of asymmetric characters
# - Keep check for variance as no changes at all if invariant.
# - How to handle uncertainties?
